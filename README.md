# Speech Emotion Recognition for Alzheimer’s Disease

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting human emotions from speech signals to support early analysis of Alzheimer’s disease using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Speech Signal Processing

## Models Implemented
- DNN (Deep Neural Network)
- RNDNN
- KELM (Kernel Extreme Learning Machine)

## Files Description
- train.py – Model training
- testing.py – Testing and evaluation
- performance.py – Performance metrics
- DNN.py, RNDNN.py, kelm.py – Model implementations

## Outcome
The system predicts emotional states from speech data which can help in analyzing cognitive health patterns.
